# GooglePlayStoreAnalysis
This project is an analysis on the dataset of a few applications in the Google Play Store to determine which are the applications that could benefit from a boosted marketing to increase their income.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout this project we are trying to figure out patterns between different applications in Google Play Store.

Initially, we clean the data as much as possible as an unclean data could affect the analysis.

After we have successfully cleaned the data, we do a few sanity checks on the dataset. For example, the highest rating of an application cannot be more than 5, and the lowest cannot be less than 1. Then we make sure if the price of the free applications are more than 0.

Then, we set out to identify the outliers. Initially we remove the pointless applications. Then we remove the superstar applications like Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc... will not help our Analysis.

Then we try out a few Data Visualization experiments to gather more insights.

Since the conventional method of trying to find the difference between two varaibles do not work, we try to find the difference between two variables by adding a different percentile to them.

We found the relation between two variables. Now, we make a pivot table to find patterns between three variables. 

Then, we plot the months of the year to try and find if there is a pattern in different months of the year.

Finally, we can see that, in the months 6, 7 & 8, the amount of installs for the "Teen" apps are more. The number of ratings are also increasing during these 3 months according to the line graph above. This means that something is enabling the "Teen" apps to do well during these 3 months. A possible explanation to this is that most of the schools in Europe and the Americas have summer breaks during these 3 months. This is a time that the teens are having a lot of free time and installing a lot of the apps.

We can also note that the ratings fall back to normal after the summer break is over.
